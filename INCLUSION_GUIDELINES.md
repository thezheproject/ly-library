# GNU LilyPond 乐谱库收录准则
本仓库是一个以收集 GNU LilyPond 乐谱为主的公共性仓库。为使乐谱的质量得以保障，制定本《收录准则》。

## 1. 基本要求
1.1 只有曲目章节完整（即拥有主副歌或完整乐章）的歌曲才能被收录。

1.2 收录的乐谱必须无任何严重的错误，代码格式符合 LilyPond 规范，且规范标注曲名、作词、作曲等必要的基本信息。

1.3 收录的乐谱必须在总目录（根目录下的`library.json`）中拥有数据。具体包含:

* 歌曲基本信息
* 制谱者信息
* 对应的乐谱文件、参考谱图和/或转写源文件（针对简谱）及文件的许可证（若适用）
* 其他参考资料（若有）

总目录文件的编写规范另定。

## 2. 内容要求
2.1 原则上，本仓库不限制收录歌曲的种类、形式和创作风格。

2.2 有以下情形之一的创作者，其作品原则上不予收录：

  2.2.1 涉毒、涉暴、涉恐及其它严重违反道德、法律的行为。
    
  2.2.2 多次被举报有性别歧视行为，或发生过严重的不正当性关系。
    
  2.2.3 多次抄袭他人作品或洗歌、不尊重他人意愿翻改、盗歌等。
    
若有例外情况，需先在收录前进行实证分析，再决定是否收录。

2.5 符合条件的示例歌曲（如各歌声合成软件声库的预览曲、MIDI 设备的示例曲等）可予收录，但需在总目录的对应数据中标记。

2.6 从音乐类教材摘录下来的乐谱，若教材的出版单位对乐谱所对应的歌曲声明版权，在未取得书面授权的情况下一般不予收录。

2.7 收录原创 ACGN 角色的印象曲，需确保角色设定不违反 2.3 条之规定，创作者没有 2.2 条所述之情形，且征得角色创作者和歌曲创作者双方的书面同意。

2.8 上两条中所提到的书面授权或同意文件，统一作为参考资料录入总目录的数据中。

## 3. 附则

# The GNU LilyPond Sheets Library's Inclusion Guidelines (English Version)

This library is a public repository primarily for collecting sheet music which are made by using GNU LilyPond. To ensure the quality of these sheet music, this *Inclusion Guidelines* have been established.

## 1. Basic Requirements
1.1 Only songs with complete sections (i.e., featuring both main and secondary verses or complete movements) can be included.

1.2 The sheet music must be free of any serious errors, conform to LilyPond coding standards, and properly label essential information such as the song title, lyrics, and composer.

1.3 The sheet music must be represented in the main catalog (the `library.json` file in the root directory). The specific information required includes:

* Basic song information
* Information about the arranger
* Corresponding sheet music files, reference scores, and/or transcription source files (for simplified notation, or *jianpu*) along with their licenses (if applicable)
* Other reference materials (if any)

The writing standards for the main catalog file is defined separately.

## 2. Content Requirements
2.1 In principle, the library does not limit the type, form, or creative style of the songs included.

2.2 Works by creators who fall under any of the following circumstances will generally not be included:

  2.2.1 Involvement in drug-related, violent, or terrorist activities, or other serious violations of morals and law.
    
  2.2.2 Repeated reports of gender discrimination or serious improper sexual conduct.
    
  2.2.3 Repeated acts of plagiarism, unauthorized alterations, or theft of others' songs.
    
In exceptional cases, an empirical analysis must be conducted before inclusion, and a decision will be made based on the results.

2.3 Songs containing drug-related, terrorist, or strongly pornographic or violent content will never be included. For political content, if not clearly biased, may be included, but uncertain cases require empirical analysis to determine eligibility.

2.4 Exclusive songs from various rhythm games may be included, provided that the copyright holder and/or creator has not explicitly prohibited it. However, the repository owner and arranger disclaim any risks and associated responsibilities, and the sheet music and transcription files (for simplified notation, or *jianpu*) must be licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#LGPL) (with any version). This rule also applies to similar songs and fan-created songs from other ACGN (Animation, Comics, Games, Novels) works.

2.5 Example songs (such as preview songs from various voice synthesis software's voice banks or MIDI devices' example songs) may be included, but must be marked in the corresponding data in the main catalog.

2.6 Sheet music excerpted from music textbooks will generally not be included if the publishing entity claims copyright over the song, unless written authorization is obtained.

2.7 For original ACGN character image songs, it must be ensured that the character setting does not violate Article 2.3, that the creator does not fall under the circumstances described in Article 2.2, and that written consent is obtained from both the character creator and the song creator.

2.8 The written authorization or consent documents mentioned in the above two articles must be uniformly included as reference materials in the data of the main catalog.

## 3. Additional Provisions
3.1 The ZHE Project, owner of this repository, retains the right to interpret these guidelines.

3.2 Suggestions and comments on these guidelines must be submitted through issues, and will be adopted after discussion.

3.3 These guidelines take effect from the date of publication.
